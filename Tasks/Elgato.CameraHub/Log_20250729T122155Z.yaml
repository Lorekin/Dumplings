    What’s new in Camera Hub 2.1?
    Camera Hub 2.1 adds support for our newly released Facecam 4K, and introduces Nintendo Switch 2 compatibility for Facecam Neo, Facecam MK.2, and Facecam 4K. Also included in this update are quality-of-life improvements across LUTs, backgrounds, and Prompter.
    ⚠️ Important Note: Camera Hub 2.1 now requires macOS 13.3 or later.

    🌟 Facecam 4K joins the lineup
    Launching with Camera Hub 2.1, Facecam 4K is our most powerful webcam yet—delivering uncompressed 4K60 video, full manual control, and cinematic effects. It also supports industry-standard 49 mm lens filters, so you can shape light, control reflections, or add creative flair just like on a DSLR.
