    Hello!
    It’s been a while since our last patch for Gigapixel AI, and this update brings important improvements to align with our latest company changes. While this release represents a significant shift for all our users, we’re excited about the future and what’s ahead. We’re committed to carrying Gigapixel’s legacy forward with our new Studio release.
    Gigapixel AI will continue to receive occasional minor patch updates, but new AI models and major features will be introduced in the Studio versions of our desktop apps.
    Thank you!
    Esther H.
    Associate Product Manager
