    Changed
    - In the CMake build system, whether GTK-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GTK={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    - The CMake build system now includes man pages for the circo, dot2gxl, fdp, gv2gml, gv2gxl, gvmap.sh, gxl2dot, neato, sfdp, and twopi aliases. #1753, #2530
    - In the CMake build system, whether Poppler-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_POPPLER={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    - The gvpr -a option is no longer limited to 100 arguments. It is limited now only by available memory.
    - In the CMake build system, whether librsvg-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_RSVG={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    - In the CMake build system, whether libwebp-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_WEBP={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    - Breaking: The CDT_VERSION macro has been updated to reflect the last time an API-breaking change was made. This should have happened in Graphviz 9.0.0 and then multiple other releases since then. #2722
    - In the CMake build system, whether X11-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_X={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    - The graphviz_version.h header includes macros GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MAJOR, GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_MINOR, GRAPHVIZ_VERSION_PATCH for compile-time discrimination based on the Graphviz version. #2716
    - The CMake build system no longer allows overriding the Graphviz version with -DVERSION=….
    - Breaking: The agcanonStr function has been removed.
    Fixed
    - The CMake build system no longer installs an sfdp alias when SFDP is disabled (-Dwith_sfdp=OFF).
    - The plugin version in pre-built Fedora and Rocky Linux packages has been corrected 6 → 8. This change should have happened in Graphviz 13.0.0.
    - Empty HTML-like labels (<>) are once again processed successfully. This was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.0. #2727
    - Some typos in the cgraph man page have been fixed.
