    Changed
    - DFLT_GVPRPATH, a $PATH-like variable that gvpr uses to locate user-referenced files, is now computed at runtime instead of build time. This removes a barrier to relocating a Graphviz installation from one directory to another.
    - In the CMake build system, whether GDK-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GDK={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2714
    Fixed
    - Gvedit and Smyrna on MinGW can now correctly locate their supporting runtime data directories.
    - The gvpr options -v for printing verbose messages is documented. This has been supported since Graphviz 2.30 but undocumented.
    - When using the CMake build system, DFLT_GVPRPATH is no longer incorrectly missing a ".:" prefix.
    - On macOS, processing graphs involving URLs with the Quartz plugin is once again possible. Previously this would crash. This was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.1. #2712
    - In gvpr, updating a map or deleting items from the map no longer triggers a use-after-free. #2707
