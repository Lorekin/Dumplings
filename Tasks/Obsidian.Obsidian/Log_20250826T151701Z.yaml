    Shiny new things
    This update introduces a new migration assistant for Obsidian Sync. This tool will allow you to perform migrations for your remote Sync vaults, such as encryption upgrades, and in the future the ability to switch regions. Learn more
    Obsidian occasionally upgrades Sync encryption to maintain the highest security standards. If an encryption upgrade is available you will see an option titled "Upgrade vault encryption" in Obsidian Settings â†’ Sync.
    Improvements
    - We have added in-app checks for plugins known to cause issues with Obsidian 1.9:
      - Commander v0.5.4 caused the mobile toolbar to take up the entire screen. This is fixed in the latest version of the plugin, so you just need to remember to update.
      - The "Image Toolkit" plugin causes issues with the display of Obsidian's menus. Once there is a new version of this plugin available, it can be re-enabled.
    - Drastically improved the performance of the Search view.
    No longer broken
    - Bases: Fixed view not refreshing after renaming the currently active view.
    - Bases: Fixed file.tags.contains() not finding files with parent tags (e.g. a/b should match when looking for "a").
    - Properties: Fixed context menu immediately hiding after right-clicking in Local Properties view.
    Developers
    - The installer has been updated to use Electron v37.3.1 (requires downloading the latest installer).
