    Important functions
    A new image processing tool has been added, which can be connected to image models for image processing.
    If the OpenRouter apikey is connected, we will default to enabling and using the google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview:free model for image processing for you. You can switch or turn off the model in the Settings/Tool configuration
