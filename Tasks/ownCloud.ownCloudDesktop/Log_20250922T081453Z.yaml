    - Bugfix - Fix location loading on Mac: #6761
      https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6761
    - Bugfix - Schedule syncs after an abort: #11396
      We fixed a bug where the client stopped scheduling syncs after a sync was aborted.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11396
    - Bugfix - Fix description of manage public links action: #11450
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11450
    - Bugfix - Fix early-use crash in the folder watcher on Linux: #11460
      In a few error scenarios, the folder watcher on Linux shows a dialog with an error message. A crash has been fixed where this occurred before the GUI was fully initialised.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11460 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11475
    - Bugfix - Properly encode scope and prompt items in OAuth URL: #11472
      Fixed a bug where the scope and prompt items of an OAuth query would not be encoded, resulting in an invalid request.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11472 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11479
    - Bugfix - Client stuck in reconnecting state after application start: #11478
      We fixed a bug where the client was starting OAuth authentication but did not prompt the user properly to renew authentication. This resulted in the client apparently getting stuck in the "reconnecting" state.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11478
    - Bugfix - Strip user information from new-connection URL: #11497
      Credentials in the URL are not supported for some time. This fix strips them from the URL before storage and using it to authenticate the client to the server.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11497 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11509
    - Bugfix - Support logging redirect: #11581
      We now log when all urls when a request was redirected.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11581
    - Bugfix - Don't store null certificates in the account: #11621
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11621
    - Bugfix - Fix crash for folders that could not be initialized: #11664
      We fixed a bug where interacting with a folder in the file browser could lead to a crash if the folder was not properly initialized.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11664
    - Bugfix - Make open account in browser accessible for keyboard navigation: #11772
      On the account settings page, the status label contained the URL of the server. This URL was not accessible with keyboard navigation or when a screen-reader was used. Now there is an "Open in Web Browser" action in the pop-up menu of the "Manage Account" button (which is next to the status label), and the URL has been removed from the status label.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11772 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11800 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11810
    - Bugfix - Don't log misleading error if dynamic registration failed: #11839
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11839
    - Bugfix - Fix crash after resource job fails: #12045
      When a network error occurs while fetching a resource (e.g. a space image), no icon is available, and a crash would occur. This is fixed by returning an empty icon.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12045
    - Bugfix - Remove any existing ResourceCache directories for accounts: #12214
      Some versions of the client failed to remove the temporary cache directory on exit. This can result in multiple GB of cached space images. These cache directories are now cleaned up before creating a new cache.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12214
    - Bugfix - Delete account-specific caches when an account is removed: #12224
      This includes the cache for space images, as well as certain cached network jobs.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12224
    - Change - Revert local folder name back to pre 3.0 behavior: #6390
      Due to user requests, we reverted the folder name from

      https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6390
    - Change - Make messages translatable that occur early in start-up: #11142
      These messages include the command-line messages (both errors and the help text). To do this, the deprecated --confdir option has been removed. This option was only used on windows before roaming profiles were supported.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11142 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11246 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11300
    - Change - Remove unused command line option --language: #11245
      This option was used before the UI language could be chosen in the settings. The option --list-languages is also removed, as it no longer serves a purpose.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11245 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11270
    - Change - Windows: always use fusion style: #11275
      We already used the fusion style on Windows for years if the system used dpi scaling. Since Qt6.5 the fusion style also support the dark theme on Windows. Those two reasons convinced us that always using the fusion style on Windows will result in the best experience for the users.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11275
    - Change - Deprecate suffix VFS: #11325
      We decided to deprecate the suffix VFS implementations and thus prepare its removal in 7.0.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11325
    - Change - Removal of selective sync tree from account status page: #11357
      We removed the selective sync support from the main widget and moved it to its own dialog, available through the context menu of the sync folder.
      Having both the sync status and the selective sync settings in the same widget caused a lot of problems and overhead over the years. Additionally, it required us to maintain a lot of special and basically duplicated code, as we already had a dedicated widget to handle selective sync.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11357 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11357 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8102 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5423 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4080 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11524
    - Change - Fix three badly styled warning messages: #11412
      There were 3 labels for warning messages that were nearly unreadable in dark mode due to bad styling. These have been changed to only use a bold font, but are now displayed with a big warning icon on their left. The places are: the account settings page, the folder wizard remote path page, and the log browser.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11412 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11470
    - Change - Removed support for limiting sync of big new folder & external storage: #11517
      We removed an option which allowed to block new folders bigger than a set limit, from being synchronized automatically, when selective synchronization is used. Additionally, we removed the option that allowed to block automatic synchronization of external storage.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11517
    - Change - Set the 'No' button as default action in the Unknown Certificate dialog: #11531
      When an unknown certificate is used by the server, the safe action is to reject this certificate. So the default action for this dialog should be not to accept this unknown certificate.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11531
    - Change - Remove Remove all files dialog: #11569
      We no longer ask the user whether all files should be removed but just sync.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11569 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7304
    - Change - Rewrite of the spaces browser: #11595
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11595
    - Change - New update channel for ownCloud infinite scale: #11742
      The release series 6 is a long term release. As version 7 will drop the support for ownCloud 10, users will either have to select the ownCloud infinite scale update channel in the about-dialog or manually install a newer release. This change only affects the unbranded version.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11742
    - Change - Remove support for branded shell extensions on Linux: #11743
      From now on user will have to install dolphin-owncloud nautilus-owncloud instead of a branded version.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11743
    - Change - Only allow to add un-synced spaces: #11752
      We now prevent users from syncing the same space multiple times.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11752 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11759
    - Change - Rewrite of the login widget in QML: #11856
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11856
    - Change - Only support APFS on macOS: #12044
      Apple File System in contrary to HFS+ is Unicode normalization preserving. To support this properly the upcoming version 6 of desktop client will support NFC and NFD encoding on all client platforms based on the individual characteristics.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12044
    - Change - Bump minimum macOS version to 13.0: #12245
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12245 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12246
    - Change - Update the sync exclude list for Infinite Scale: #12262
      Files with the extension .space and .psec are now excluded from sync by default.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12262 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12093
    - Enhancement - Add option to pause synchronization on metered connections: #4808
      On platforms that support metered-connection detection, an option is now available to pause folder synchronization when the network connection switches to metered-connection. When synchronization is paused, force-syncing can still be done.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4808 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11305
    - Enhancement - Add option to move files to trash instead of deleting: #9001
      An option has been added that when files on the server are deleted, the client will move them to the system trash bin instead of deleting those files.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9001 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11320
    - Enhancement - Prevent same default sync folder for multiple accounts with Spaces: #11204
      This is done by tagging the sync folder by an extended attribute (Linux/macOS) or an alternative data stream (Windows).
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11204 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11364
    - Enhancement - Use less modal dialogs: #11304
      As the rather high number of modal dialogs we used caused different issues on different platforms, we decided to use them less often and try other concepts.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11304 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11032 https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11208
    - Enhancement - Include recent changes in scheduled syncs: #11347
      When starting a new sync we now also include the recent change events in the discovery.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11347
    - Enhancement - Improve handling of a server blocking an unsupported client: #11424
      We improved the handling of HTTP 403 status codes.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11424
    - Enhancement - Ask user to restart application when update is available on Windows: #11442
      Instead of a tray message, we now display a modal dialog on Windows to inform the user about a downloaded update. Also, we now can prompt the user to restart the application and apply the update immediately, adding a bit of user comfort.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11442
    - Enhancement - New Folder status: #11491
      We rewrote the Folder status page.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11527 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11491
    - Enhancement - Pause sync when behind a captive portal: #11533
      When the operating system detects a captive portal, stop all outgoing network requests. These requests will fail with an SSL certificate mismatch error. When the captive portal is "gone", synchronisation will be restarted.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11533 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11567
    - Enhancement - Support for prompt_values_supported in openid-configuration: #11729
      We implemented support for idP's to specify the supported prompt values.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11729 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12163
    - Enhancement - New branding option: automatically sync new spaces: #11751
      A branding option was added to add new sync connections for newly discovered spaces.
      https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11751 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11774
    - Enhancement - Display how many spaces are un-synced: #11760
