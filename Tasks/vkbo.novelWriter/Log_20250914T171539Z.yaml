    Release Notes
    This is a patch release that fixes an issue related to crashes when using the completer menu under certain conditions, and improves positioning of the input box for CJK languages.
    Detailed Changelog
    Bugfixes
    - Fixes an issue where the app would crash of deleting the @ character with the completer menu visible and the text margins of the editor set to "justified". This is likely crashing due to some unhandled corner case in the Qt library, but the implementation of the completer menu in novelWriter uses a small hack to bypass some intended behaviour of the menu. Extra steps have been added to the implementation that seems to avoid the crash. Issue #2510. PR #2511.
    - Fixes an issue where the input box that shows up when typing CJK languages were covering the text due to an incorrect offset of the box location. The incorrect offset is caused by the text margins not being taken into account. Fix by @Euophrys based on solution by @Jack-name. Issues #2267 and #2517. PR #2518.
