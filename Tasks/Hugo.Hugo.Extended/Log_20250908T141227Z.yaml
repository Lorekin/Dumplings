    The big new feature in this relase is the new version config option on Module imports, which allows you to set the requested module version query directly in your Hugo configuration (e.g. hugo.toml). This is a feature that have been requested by many, and I (@bep) was reminded about it by this recent thread, which also outlines a common use case for this: Mounting multiple old versions/branches of API documentation into the project.
