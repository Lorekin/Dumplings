    Logs command
    This release introduces a new sentry-cli logs list command, which lists your Sentry logs. For more details, see sentry-cli logs list --help.
    Please note: if you receive a 403 error when using the new command, you may need to generate a new auth token with different permissions. You can do this by navigating to Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Tokens in Sentry. On the Personal Tokens page, generate a token with org:read scope, and pass this to the command using --auth-token or by setting the SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.
