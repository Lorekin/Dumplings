    Updates
    - Grain Match – Improved Duplication Workflow
      - When duplicating an item that belongs to a grain match group, you’ll now be prompted whether to copy the group as well.
      - If you choose to keep the group, the grain match dialog opens, and the copied panels are automatically shifted to the end of their rows to prevent overlapping.

    - Grain Match – Arrow Indicators
      - Added arrow controls in the grain match preview to let you move selected panels more easily.

    - Regional Settings Visibility
      - You can now quickly view your Windows regional settings directly in the Currency Settings menu.
      - This makes it easier to confirm symbols (e.g., for CSV imports) when troubleshooting or debugging.
    Fixes
    - Grain Match – Move Right Arrow
      - The “move right” arrow is now correctly disabled when the panel cannot be moved further.

    - Panel Item List Report – Holes and Grooving
      - The Panel Item List report now displays holes and grooving details in the correct columns.
