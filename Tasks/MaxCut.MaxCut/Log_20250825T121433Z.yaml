    New Features
    - Experimental Features Toggle
      - Added a setting that lets users opt into experimental features that are almost ready for public release.
      - Users can enable this via Settings > General Settings > Experimental Features and checking the 'Enable Experimental Features' checkbox.
      - Youâ€™ll need to restart MaxCut for the changes to take effect.
    Updates
    - Nested Groups in Input Item Group List Report
      - Improved handling of nested groups so they now appear within the group hierarchy.
      - Example: Instead of showing each shelf as its own group, nested shelves will now display under the main item, making the report more intuitive.
    - Input Item Editing
      - Pressing ENTER on an input item will now trigger editing the selected item rather than adding a new item.
    - Job Resources Summary Report
      - Renamed the Job Costing Summary (User Settings View) to Job Resources Summary for clarity.
      - Export button on the Summary tab now directly triggers CSV export of this report.
      - CSV export updated to include totals for Cost, Sub Total, Tax 1, Tax 2, Profit, and Grand Total.
    - Business Edition Feature Access
      - Adjusted feature limitations to allow Community Edition (CE) users to experience more Business Edition (BE) features, instead of being completely restricted.
    Fixes
    - Optimization Error Handling
      - Added validation for extremely large values in cost and pricing fields when managing materials, preventing errors during optimization.
      - This improvement ensures smoother material imports and reduces the chance of crashes caused by unusual data.
      - Users will now see clearer messages if unexpected values are detected, making it easier to spot and fix formatting issues early.
    - Selected Material Summary
      - The Selected Material Summary now displays correctly in the Optimized Sheets tab, giving users clearer visibility of chosen materials during optimization.
    - Sheet Materials Import
      - MaxCut now automatically detects and handles whether the first row of a sheet materials file should be excluded, removing the need for manual settings and making imports more reliable.
