    New Features and Improvements in Foxit PDF Editor Subscription Release 2025.2.0.33046
    - New features and enhancements for AI Assistant
      - Foxit PDF Editor is the first PDF solution to natively support Model Context Protocol (MCP), seamlessly connecting your documents to external tools. With MCP integration, the built-in AI Assistant lets you trigger actions like “Create a Jira issue” or “Send to Salesforce” directly from your PDF, no app-switching, fewer clicks, and more time saved.
      - Enhance the Intelligent Read feature by enabling the reading of document summaries aloud and turning document content into a two-person podcast-style conversation, offering a faster, more engaging way to consume documents.
      - Integrate live Web Search to bring up-to-date, relevant external context from the web into conversations, accessible directly within the AI Chat interface.
      - Agentic document chatting supports advanced reasoning and context-aware answers, minimizes hallucinations and guesswork, and improves accuracy when navigating complex content.
    - Enhancements to the Binder feature (Pro only)
      - Create a PDF binder from an existing template in iManage 10.
      - Open and edit an existing binder project directly from iManage 10, and then save it back to iManage10.
      - Allow users to drag and drop files into a folder to rearrange documents within the binder.
    - The Combine Files feature allows users to preview page thumbnails of each file and rearrange pages by deleting or reordering thumbnails before combining the files.
    - Provide a native 64-bit version of the application to enhance the performance on 64-bit systems.
    - Provide support for Microsoft’s Double Key Encryption (DKE), which protects highly sensitive data by using two encryption keys—one controlled by the user and another stored securely in Microsoft Azure.
    - Enable admins to use deployment tools to configure a shared location for templates, including watermarks, backgrounds, headers/footers, and stamps, across the organization.
    - Compatible with USB writing pads for users to add handwritten signatures as stamps in PDFs conveniently.
    - Encrypt and decrypt PDF files using AES GCM encryption algorithm in compliance with ISO/TS 32003.
