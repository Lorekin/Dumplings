      - Added <edit=check> to display a checkbox in the Template Results table. Clicking the checkbox assigns either 1 or 0 to the variable.

      - Added <edit=flags> to interpret an enum as a set of flags.
      - When using flags, the variable value shows each flag separated by '|' (for example 'ONE | TWO | THREE'), and clicking the down arrow shows a list of checkboxes for each possible flag.
      - Variables may now be defined inside 'for' statements; for example 'for( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ )'. These variables are always created as local variables.
      - Added <warn=false> to turn off warnings for a particular variable.
      - The <hidden> attribute may now be any expression or function.

      - 'Jump to Template Variable' now works better with disjoint structs.
      - On-demand structs apply colors more consistently when they are opened.
    - Find
      - Incremental Find now automatically searches for values as you type in the Find Bar.

      - In the Find Bar, can also click the up arrow next to the 'All' button and select 'Add Highlighter'.
      - Turn Highlights on or off using 'View > Highlighting' and the highlights are persistent.
      - Highlights have options for match case, match whole word, and colors.
      - Highlights can either be applied to individual files or can be applied to all files that share an Edit As (see Scope in the Highlights Options dialog).
      - Other Find expressions can be used by placing a comma and a type specifier after the expression to highlight. For example, use "67 4F,h" to highlight the hex bytes 67 and 4F.
      - If a Highlight has been applied to the current file, right-click on the file and select 'Clear File Highlights' to turn off the highlights.
      - Highlights now have a separate default color for text and hex.
      - Added 'Zeros' highlighting rule for highlighting all 00 bytes.
      - Added 'View > Highlighting > Auto-Highlight Options' menu with 'Match Case' and 'Match Whole Word'.
