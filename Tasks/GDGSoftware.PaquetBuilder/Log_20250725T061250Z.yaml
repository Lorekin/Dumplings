    - Changed project saving behavior: projects created with older versions are now consistently saved in UTF-8 format.
    - Resolved Unicode encoding issues with emoticons to ensure correct display in dialog boxes.
    - Fixed the Sleep custom action that was not working as expected with the new C compiler.
    - Updated error reporting for SignTool: instead of displaying an error message when SignTool is not found, a notification is now shown in the status bar.
    - Enhanced WebUpdate filtering: items intended exclusively for 64-bit (and 32-bit) systems are now properly filtered.
    - Fixed the CRC calculation in the WebUpdate module: it now computes the CRC based on the file content rather than the string representation.
    - Introduced a silent installation option for Paquet Builder to enable streamlined deployments.
    - Minor bug fixes and optimizations.
