    All systems:
    - ðŸ—² Breaking: Remove commandline argument --mode {parse,raw} in favor of a new argument --parse-text {True, False}.
    - Add (optional) QR-Code and barcode detection.
    - Add option --screenshot-handler to explicitly choose among available methods.
    - Fix language downloads for some specific languages by falling back to different model type (#744).
    Windows:
    - Add automatic export of debug logs (when running normcap.exe -v debug) to {DESKTOP_FOLDER}\normcap.log for easier access.
    - Fix crash on start if user directory contains special characters (#608).
    Linux:
    - ðŸ—² Breaking: Drop support for Ubuntu 20.04 and Gnome < 41.0
    - ðŸ—² Deprecating: AppImage builds are being deprecated. Even with a lot of effort, it turns out that AppImage is too unreliable. (We will still build AppImage for a while, but they might go away any time.)
    - Change priority of clipboard handlers: wl-clipboard is now lowest priority (as it seems least reliable), below xsel and xclip. (Please open an issues, if this doesn't work well for you.)
    - Add handlers to take screenshots via gnome-screenshot or spectacle. Should mitigate some issue for screenshots on Wayland (not all!).
    - Fix AppImage requires libcrypt, which is not the case anymore.
    - Fix NormCap not getting focus when moved with Gnome extension "Window Calls"
    - Fix trying incompatible screenshot and clipboard handlers in Flatpak.
    MacOS:
    - ðŸ—² Breaking: Drop support for macOS 12 (Monterey) and older.
