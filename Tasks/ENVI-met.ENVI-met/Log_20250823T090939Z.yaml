    For everyone
    UX
    - ENVI-core: Reduced simulation times by 20-50% (depending on model area size) through optimized background processes
    - Leonardo: Decreased loading times when opening outputs (especially larger models)
    - NetCDF libraries are now bundled with ENVI-met and no longer need to be installed separately
    - NetCDF files are automatically generated during simulation
    - Nesting cells are per default not written into the outputs anymore
    - Added the option to opt-out of email notifications through a tag in the .SIMX
    UI
    - Added “Advanced Settings” toggle in Leonardo and Spaces to access older options
    Bugfixes
    - Leonardo: Fixed the display of wind vectors
    - ENVI-core: Fixed a greening module issue and corrected the amount of reflected shortwave radiation
    - OAuth: Fixed a bug preventing to log in again after PC went into stand-by
    For business users
    - Web-Based Reporting Tool: Easily upload your simulation data to your new personal project cloud, to explore it through our new interactive visualization tool, and to generate professional reports tailored for stakeholders
    - Running isolated modules: ENVI-met now allows single-module simulations for solar radiation and wind. This enables focused environmental analyses without running a full holistic model, significantly reducing simulation time when only specific factors are needed
