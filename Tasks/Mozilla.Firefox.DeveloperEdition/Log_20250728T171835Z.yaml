    New
    - On Windows, clicking a persistent notification when Firefox is closed or restarted, will now properly open Firefox with the relevant webpage, instead of just opening the main page of the website.
    - ETP-Strict mode now supports a flexible exception list to fix broken site features caused by tracker blocking. Exceptions are split into baseline (core functionality) and convenience (extra features), letting users choose improved site compatibility without compromising key privacy protections.
    Fixed
    - Improved the scroll speed in the bookmarks dialog to not go beyond the component area.
    - Improved Drag-and-drop support for blob images.
    Developer
    - Firefox now supports the Prioritized Task Scheduling API, enabling developers to assign and manage task priorities.
    - The Selection.getComposedRanges() API is now available, allowing developers to accurately get selected text ranges across shadow DOM boundaries.
    - Added support for the URLPattern Web API, enabling developers to match and parse URLs using a standardized pattern syntax.
    - Firefox now supports the wllama API for extensions, enabling developers to integrate local language model (LLM) capabilities directly into their add-ons.
