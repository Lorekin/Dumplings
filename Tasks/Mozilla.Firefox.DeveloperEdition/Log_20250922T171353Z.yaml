    New
    - You can now close a Picture-in-Picture window without pausing the video. Press Shift + Click on the close button or use Shift + Esc to exit while keeping playback uninterrupted.
    - Logins in the Firefox Password Manager are now encrypted using a more modern encryption scheme, switching from 3DES-CBC to AES-256-CBC. This change only affects the local encryption of logins on the disk; logins synced through Firefox Sync are end-to-end encrypted independently and have already been using a strong encryption scheme (AES-256-GCM) previously.
    Changed
    - On Windows, when opening a link from another application, Firefox will only use a window on the current virtual desktop or open a new window if needed.
    - On Firefox for Android, the "Allow screenshots in private browsing" setting has been removed.

    Web Platform
    - Firefox now supports the Element.moveBefore API.
    - Firefox now supports math-shift compact.
    - Firefox now supports the WebGPU GPUDevice.importExternalTexture API on Windows.
    - Firefox now supports PerformanceEventTiming.interactionId, allowing developers to group related input events. This enables support for the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) responsiveness metric.
    - Firefox now supports the command and commandfor attributes.
    - Firefox now supports the View Transition API. The View Transition API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views.
    - The resizeMode getUserMedia constraint is now available, allowing developers to crop and downscale video captured from a camera to any resolution they choose.
    - Dithering is now applied when linear-gradient, conic-gradient, and radial-gradient are rendered using hardware WebRender.
    - Firefox now supports the upsert proposal. This adds getOrInsert and getOrInsertComputed methods to Map and WeakMap. These methods either return the value associated with a key, or insert a default value, and then return that value, simplifying handling of cases where it's not known if a key is already present in the Map or WeakMap.
    - Firefox now supports the lock() and unlock() methods of ScreenOrientation interface on Windows tablets and Android devices.
    - Implemented worker transfer for RTCDataChannel.
    - WebCodecs on Windows now has a batch-encoding path for VideoEncoder, improving performance with higher throughput and lower submission latency due to a larger default batch size.
