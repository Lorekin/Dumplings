    - When a site asks for camera access, it can now be previewed in the permission dialog. This is especially helpful when switching between multiple cameras.
    - Tapping a persistent notification when Firefox for Android is closed or restarted now properly opens Firefox with the relevant webpage.
    - Firefox has expanded its Fingerprinting Protection by reporting constant values for several more attributes of user's computers. More Details
    - When downloading a file in private browsing mode, the user will be prompted to chose whether they want to keep or delete files that are downloaded while in private browsing. This preference can also be set at about:settings.
    - With Firefox for Android, you can now see your download progress in real time, with controls to pause, resume, retry, or cancel â€” all from the Downloads screen.
    - Firefox for Android users can now configure DNS over HTTPS in the settings UI.
    - Added support for running websites as web apps for Firefox on Windows. These are sites that you can pin and run as simplified windows directly from the taskbar, without loosing access to Add-ons. This feature is not available at this time for Firefox installs from the Microsoft Store.

    - Unchecking the Group Similar Messages setting now prevents successive similar messages from being grouped so that all messages are displayed in the output.
    Web Platform
    - Firefox now supports xHE-AAC audio playback on Windows 11 22H2+, macOS, and Android 9+.
    - <input type=color> now recognizes the CSS <color> format in addition to the color hex format (#ffffff). This means that color names like black and more complex strings like rgb(200 200 200) are now valid inputs. For now the value will always be converted to the hex format.
    - Firefox now uses an updated grid sizing algorithm to better align with the CSS Grid specification. Grid layouts that use percentage row sizes or grid items containing elements with aspect ratios (such as images) will now render correctly in more cases.
    - Restrictions were removed that prevented setting the display property on <details> elements, and a ::details-content pseudo-element was added to style the expandable/collapsible contents of those elements.
