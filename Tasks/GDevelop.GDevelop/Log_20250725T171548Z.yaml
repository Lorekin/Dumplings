    ü™ü Separate side panel for "Ask AI"
    The "Ask AI" tab is now shown as a separate pane (or a drawer on small screens):

    üïπ Premium Game Templates
    - [Impostor Alert] Bugs fixes & new tileset:
      - Fixed a bug, when the impostor kills everyone it shows DEFEAT screen to everyone including the impostor (now it shows DEFEAT for the crewmates and VICTORY for the impostor).
      - Fixed a bug, if a player has disconnected during the match, and crewmates has finished all their tasks, no victory happens because the disconnected player didn't finish his tasks, (now even if a player has disconnected, the game will auto update its tasks' data to the new number of players currently in the match, and trigger victory when all tasks have finished).
      - Quests bar will auto update if a player has disconnected during the match.
      - Included the game map tileset in the Assets folder, in case the user want to change/update the map.
