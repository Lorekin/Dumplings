    üöÄ New Features
    Default dashboard tab now set to ‚ÄúLast active tab‚Äù by default
    In the previous version of ISL Light, we introduced a new setting under the Default Dashboard configuration, which determines which tab is shown after logging in. The setting, called Last Active Tab, ensures that if users exit the application while on the Computers tab, the same tab will be shown upon relaunching and logging in. The same behavior applies if the Session tab was active before closing the application. This option is now the default value for the Default Dashboard setting.
    Add SNI support for AutoTransport in permissive SSL mode
    The AutoTransport methods wsstun-direct, wsstun-proxy, https-direct, and https-proxy were updated to include Server Name Indication (SNI) during the SSL handshake.
    This change improves compatibility with third-party load balancers such as Cloudflare, which rely on the hostname being sent as part of the handshake.
    Update to mbedTLS 2.28.10
    The internal mbedTLS library has been updated to version 2.28.10.
    Upgrade to libdatachannel 0.22.6 and libjuice 1.5.9
    We upgraded libdatachannel to version 0.22.6 and libjuice to version 1.5.9.
    üêû Bug Fixes
    Multiple monitor button behavior
    An issue was identified when using the multiple monitors feature (opening each remote monitor in a separate view). Although separate views were created, the monitor selection was incorrect‚Äîview one would select monitor 1, but view two would show the entire desktop. This functionality has been redesigned to correctly assign each view to the respective remote monitor.
    Monitor shortcuts not working with multiple monitor views
    In case users used multiple monitors functionality ( each remote monitor in it‚Äôs own view ), the monitors shortcuts did not work. Support for monitor shortcuts was added, so users are now able to switch between monitors also when they are using multiple monitors functionality.
    Always enable TLS for AT MUX channels
    Previously, some MUX channels were not protected by a TLS session. TLS is now always enabled for all MUX channels.
    Change dots to underscores for filename on Linux
    In previous versions, Linux filenames used dots as delimiters in the version string. This caused an issue when the build number was below 10, as Linux systems sometimes interpreted the file as a manual page and opened it in a text editor. Filenames now use underscores instead of dots, ensuring the application always starts correctly.
    Incorrect copyright
    When checking the file properties of the downloaded ISL Light application, users would see incorrect copyright information. This issue has been resolved. The application‚Äôs details now correctly display XLAB d.o.o. as the copyright.
    One-time password prompt appearing incorrectly
    If ISL AlwaysOn was configured to support both one-time password and native-only authentication (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux account passwords), ISL Light would incorrectly show a one-time password prompt‚Äîeven when native-only authentication was active. The connection prompt has been redesigned to hide the one-time password input in such cases.
    Removed ‚ÄúVerify your email‚Äù screen during signup
    Previously, after clicking the Sign up button in the ISL Light application, a browser would open, and ISL Light would display a ‚ÄúVerify your email‚Äù screen. This intermediate screen has been removed. Now, clicking Sign up simply opens the signup page in the browser, while ISL Light remains on the login screen.
    Fix icon copy in secure part on macOS
    On macOS, resources could be injected in a way that caused copying to the destination folder to fail. This occurred because the operation was appended in the unsigned part of the package. It is now allowed in the signed part, enabling proper execution in the unsigned portion.
    Other fixes and improvements
    Bug fixes, security updates, missing translations, and other general improvements.
