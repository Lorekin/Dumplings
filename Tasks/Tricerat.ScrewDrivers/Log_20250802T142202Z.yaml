    Current Release
    Version 7.9.2 was released in July 2025 and is the current production release.

    Important
    Before installing this version, your Tricerat Licensing Server must be upgraded to v5.6.4.0 or later! The upgrade to v5.6.4.0 Tricerat Licensing Server needs to be completed before upgrading any server session agent to avoid license checkout issues! See this page for upgrade instructions: Upgrading Your License Server All license server releases are backwards compatible with all previous V6 and v7 releases.
    Version 7 products are not compatible with version 6 license activation codes. You will need new activation codes for version 7 products. Please contact your Salesperson for more information.

    Important
    Before installing any version 7 component, you may need to install the .NET 4.8 Runtime. Failure to do so will prevent license activation of a nodelocked license and all UIâ€™s will fail to run due to its dependency on this version of .NET. Note: Several Microsoft OS now include the .NET runtime so this step may not be required.

    Improvements and Fixes

    - ScrewDrivers Administration - fixed bug when custom owner names contain ' (apostrophe) character.
    - ScrewDrivers Advanced Print Feature - fixed several folder related issues.
    - ScrewDrivers Direct IP - fixed INF import not working with core drivers.
    - ScrewDrivers Printers - fixed several performance issues to speed up loading and filtering.
    - ScrewDrivers products now attempt to correct orphaned printers when services start.
    - ScrewDrivers macOS client installer now recognizes if Royal TSX is installed.
    - Other minor updates, fixes and logging improvements.
    Known Issues

    - This version is in-compatible with Server 2012 R2 OS. Server 2012 R2 OS is still supported by previous versions.
    - If the ScrewDrivers Administration active tab is Reporting, the report viewer will hide portions of the File->Options or Help->About windows due to a technical limitation. A workaround does exist, just change to another tab view before displaying the File->Options or Help->About window. We do not expect this to be fixed in a future version.
