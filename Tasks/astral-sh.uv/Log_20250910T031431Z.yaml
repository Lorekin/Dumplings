    Due to a bug in the release process for the new loongarch64 support (see #15762), this release was partially published and manually finished. Consequently, the uv_build artifacts were uploaded to PyPI with a PAT instead of via OIDC and the GitHub Release was published by a maintainer instead of GitHub Actions. The artifacts from GitHub Actions were used without alteration. The uv artifacts were not affected. There should be no consequences from this; we just want to be transparent about the provenance of the artifacts.
