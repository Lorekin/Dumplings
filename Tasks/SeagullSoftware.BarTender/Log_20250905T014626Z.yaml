    Minor Fixes
    - When printing a document using a BTXML script, if the initially selected printer is unavailable, the document now prints to the redirect printer correctly and marks the job as successful in Integration Builder.
    - The time it takes to print a job is no longer slowed when a large number of printers are installed.
    - On the Actions tab of a Write File action, BarTender now saves the entered file name (and path, if necessary) so when the tab is reopened the entered information is there. This fix affects Designer, Integration Builder, and Process Builder.
    - Print Preview for the Dual_Column.btw template displays the Data Entry Form with the fields and field names lined up correctly.
    - The time needed to open a file or change (redirect) a printer is now significantly less than in previous versions of BarTender.
    - BarTender no longer slows down or delays printing when using Integration Builder to automate printing with a large number of printers are installed.
ReleaseTime: 2025-09-04
