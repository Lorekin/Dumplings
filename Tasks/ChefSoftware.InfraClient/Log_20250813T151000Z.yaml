    New features
    - We added support for recipes in JSON format. This builds on earlier work that allows you to define recipes in YAML. This provides a low-code syntax for simple use cases. To write recipes in JSON, Chef resources and any user-defined parameters can be added as elements in a resources object, such as the example below:
      {
            "resources": [
                {
                    "type": "package",
                    "name": "httpd"
                },
                {
                    "type": "template",
                    "name": "/var/www/html/index.html",
                    "source": "index.html.erb"
                },
                {
                    "type": "service",
                    "name": "httpd",
                    "action": [
                        "enable",
                        "start"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }

    Compliance Phase improvements
    - We updated the inspec-core and train-core gems. (#15042)
    Resource updates
    - We added the environment property to the apt_package, dnf_package, dpkg_package, package, rpm_package, and yum_package resources. This allows you to customize package installation using environment variables for packages that donâ€™t use preseed files.
      For example:
      apt_package "percona-xtradb-cluster-server" do
          environemnt({"PERCONA_TELEMETRY_DISABLE" => "1"})
      end
      Thanks kristofvandam! (#15091)
