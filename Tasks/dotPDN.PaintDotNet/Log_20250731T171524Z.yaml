    This is a maintenance release that adds a Bulgarian translation and fixes some important bugs.
    - New: Added Bulgarian (bg) translation
    - Fixed: The Levels and Auto-Level adjustments were crashing with panoramic images due to a bug in Direct2D that caused it to attempt allocating a texture that was too large
    - Fixed: Using a non-solid fill pattern with a non-opaque color was resulting in the wrong colors being drawn to the layer due to a mixup between straight and premultiplied alpha
    - Fixed: Non-CMYK images with an embedded CMYK color profile were being rendered with completely wrong colors
    - Fixed a few small memory leaks
