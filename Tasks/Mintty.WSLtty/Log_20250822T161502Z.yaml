    - Update to Mintty 3.8.0.
    - Derive default icon from WSL launcher shortcut (mintty/wsltty#110).
    Revised WSL launching
    This release drops the wslbridge gateways by default, since there were
    notoriously frequent cases where they would have failed to work.
    Launching WSL with the Windows built-in default launcher, however,
    used to be a crook solution as it obstructed transparent terminal operation
    by hooking the Windows conhost layer into the workflow.
    This deficiency can now be compensated by patching an updated ʻconhost.exeʻ
    into Windows; see instructions about ʻconhostʻ in the mintty wiki
