    Security fixes:
    - CVE-2025-2704: fix possible ASSERT() on OpenVPN servers using --tls-crypt-v2
      Security scope: OpenVPN servers between 2.6.1 and 2.6.13 using
      --tls-crypt-v2 can be made to abort with an ASSERT() message by
      sending a particular combination of authenticated and malformed packets.
      To trigger the bug, a valid tls-crypt-v2 client key is needed, or
      network observation of a handshake with a valid tls-crypt-v2 client key.
      No crypto integrity is violated, no data is leaked, and no remote
      code execution is possible.
      This bug does not affect OpenVPN clients.
