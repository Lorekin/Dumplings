    - Improved densification normals quality for some datasets, mostly drone datasets with larger GSD.
    - Better point cloud completeness for mixed aerial and terrestrial datasets
    - Improved performance when adding new layers, placing markers, and creating geometry in projects with a large number of existing layers
    - Improve the zoom behavior in the 3D view when using a touchpad
