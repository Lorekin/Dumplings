    PhpStorm 2025.1.4 is now available (again)
    PhpStorm 2025.1.4 is a minor update, and it includes a host of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.
    Here are the most notable changes and bug fixes in this build:

    - Fix: AI Assistant chooses PhpUnit as test framework for test generation when there is no other framework configured but other run configurations exist [WI-75089]
    - Fix: HTTP client overriding variables from imported .http files does not work [IJPL-190688]
    - Fix: Can't open Junie chat in 2025.1.4 version of IDE [JUNIE-429]
    We temporarily rolled back this version due to a compatibility issue with the Junie plugin. The issue has now been resolved, and the 2025.1.4 version is once again available to install.
    The full list of changes in PhpStorm 2025.1.4 is available in the release notes.
