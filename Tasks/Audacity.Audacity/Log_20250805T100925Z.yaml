    In this release we have added support for Windows ARM64, which is in beta. Please note that it requires Windows 11 or later, and is not compatible with third-party plugins such as VST2, VST3, and OpenVINO plugins. It has not been thoroughly tested with all features and workflows, so your feedback is welcome.
