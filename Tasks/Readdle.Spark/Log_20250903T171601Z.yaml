    We’ve made lots of improvements and fixes.
    - The Undo Send timer: Catch last-minute mistakes before they reach your recipients. Head to Spark Settings > General > Undo Send Timer to give yourself more time to cancel an email send.
    - New composer from Drafts: Writing multiple emails at once? Now you can open extra composer windows directly from an existing draft using the same shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + N).
    - Rename meeting transcript headers: Keep your meeting notes tidier — open a note and click on its header to replace the auto-generated version with a custom title.
    - Delete individual emails from a thread: Click “...” next to any email in a thread to delete it.
    - Open transcripts and notes in Calendar: Switch from your Calendar to Meeting Notes in a single click — events with transcripts now include a “Open in Meeting Notes” button.
    - Close ‘More’ more easily: Click ‘More’ once to reveal your full folder list. Click it a second time to dismiss the menu.
    - "Auto-download attachment" option: Manage your bandwidth and digital safety — choose whether attachments load automatically. Head to Settings > General to switch this on or off.
    - More fixes than we can mention here. :)
