    Smart Folders help keep important emails at your fingertips.
    - Easy setup: Search for emails by sender, subject, or keyword, then save your search as a Smart Folder for instant access.
    - Always organized: Quickly jump to emails that matter most, right from the sidebar. Easily track emails from clients, invoices, unread messages, attachments, and more.
    - Flexible options: Create a Smart Folder from your search results, or via the sidebar: More > click the plus button under Smart Folders.
    - A brand-new onboarding for Spark Teams, complete with videos and feature guides to help teams get started faster.
    - Spark for Teams users can now use reactions in shared drafts and shared threads for quicker, more collaborative feedback.
    - Added Clear and Collapse buttons for Recents in the sidebar.
