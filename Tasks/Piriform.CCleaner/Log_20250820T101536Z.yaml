    In this version of CCleaner, we’ve made small but meaningful improvements to stability and multilingual usability—plus resolved a crash affecting Custom Clean.
    Taking the hassle out of PC maintenance
    This update focuses on making CCleaner more stable and easier to use, especially for our global community:
    - Improved multilingual UI
      Fixed layout and overlapping text issues in right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew.
    - Resolved Custom Clean crash
      Fixed an issue where cleaning Amazon Music could cause CCleaner to close unexpectedly.
    - Minor UI improvements
      Tooltip icons now display correctly when using right-to-left language settings.
    - Better experience in minimized view
      Resolved layout issues when the CCleaner window is minimized and resized.
    Thanks for keeping CCleaner up to date!
