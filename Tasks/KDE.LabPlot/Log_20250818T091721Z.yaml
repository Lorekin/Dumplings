    - Fix FITS import and export issues
    - Don’t show any error messages and NaN values in the process behavior chart if no column or an empty column was selected
    - Remove unwanted entries on the undo stack that were created when modifying properties of the process behavior and run charts
    - Improve the quality of the fit model preview in the properties explorer and formula view in the random values dialog on hi-dpi screens
    - Initialize the parameters for the baseline subtraction with reasonable values on first startup and improve the appearance of the preview plot
    - Fix save/load of the background color for the center value label in the process behavior chart
    In the area of small UX-improvements, we added the Shift+Enter shortcut in the Properties Explorer for all analysis curves (fitting, smooth, etc.) which allows to quickly re-calculate the results using the same shortcut as in the notebook. Furthermore, we improved the tab-order and layouts in multiple properties widgets.
    In parallel, we are also working on the new features and improvements that will arrive in the next major release which will come with multiple big and highly awaited features. We’ll introduce these features in upcoming blog posts. Stay tuned!
