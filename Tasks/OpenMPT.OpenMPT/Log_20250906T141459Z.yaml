    Pattern tab
    - [Fix] <js> Find & Replace: Selecting a Transpose value of -4 or -5 caused the replace tab to assume that the replacement note was a PC event (tx cs127).
    - [Fix] <js> Find & Replace: When finding a PC event and replacing it with a regular note, the instrument / volume fields were not always updated correctly (tx cs127).
    - [Fix] <js> Quick Channel Settings: Avoid keyboard focus trap when navigating to the first or last channel and the keyboard focus was on one of the previous / next channel controls.
    - [Fix] <js> The order list focus rectangle was sometimes not drawn with the correct colors.

    Sample tab
    - [Imp] <js> Added keyboard shortcuts for toggling loop types (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7354.0).
    - [Fix] <js> Sample slicing did not adjust the sustain loop points in the sliced samples, and did not reset the "Keep sample on disk" setting.

    IT
    - [Fix] <js> Even when the filter cutoff envelope is stopped before its first tick is applied, the filter should still be activated (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1914).

    Audio I/O
    - [Fix] <js> It was possible that OpenMPT could crash when stopping playback of a module when using bridged plugins in combination with certain ASIO drivers, likely since OpenMPT 1.31.10.00 (tx coda).

    Misc
    - [Imp] <js> Quick Start Dialog: Collapsed status of item groups is now memorized (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1916).
    - [Imp] <jh> On Windows XP and Wine 3.12 and older, messages with "don't show again" option now offer control over whether they should be shown again.
    - [Imp] <jh> Wine integration now supports RtAudio 6.
    - [Imp] <js> Several numeric input fields no longer allow arbitrary text to be entered into them.
    - [Mod] <js> In export dialogs, the currently active subsong is now chosen for export by default.
    - [Fix] <jh> Wine integration was broken on Wine 10.13 due to a Wine regression.

    Third-Party Libraries
