    Run Agents in Linear
    You can now start Background Agents directly from Linear. Delegate tasks to Cursor without leaving your issue. We've written a longer blog post with more details.

    Improved review flow in Agent terminal
    The terminal now opens on the left with a clear backdrop and border animation to highlight when itâ€™s blocking. Rejecting auto-focuses the input so you can respond immediately.

    OS Notifications from Agent
    Get native OS notifications when an agent run finishes or when input is required, for example approving a command that is not allowlisted. Enable from Settings.

    Support for MCP elicitation
    Cursor now supports MCP elicitation, a new feature in the MCP spec that allows servers to request structured input from users, such as a user preference or configuration choice. Requests are defined with JSON schemas, giving servers validated responses while ensuring users stay in control of what they share.
