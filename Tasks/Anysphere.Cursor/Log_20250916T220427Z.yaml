    Custom slash commands
    You can now create reusable prompts and quickly share them with your team. Commands are stored in .cursor/commands/[command].md. Run them by typing / in the Agent input and selecting the command from the dropdown menu.
    We've been using them for running linters, fixing compile errors, and creating PRs with detailed descriptions and conventional commits.

    Summarization triggers
    Cursor automatically summarizes long conversation for you when reaching the context window limit. You can now summarize context on-demand with the /summarize slash command. This can be useful when you don't want to create a new chat, but want to free up space in the context window.

    MCP Resources support
    We've added support for MCP Resources. Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information.
    Additionally, interpolated variables are now supported for MCP. This enables using environment variables in strings when defining configuration for MCP servers.

    Improved terminal for Agent
    When Agent decides to create a terminal to run shell commands, we've dramatically improved the stability and reliability of the environment.
    This solves known issues around terminal commands hanging and not properly exiting when completing tasks, as well as improving the SSH experience.
    We've also polished the terminal UI, made it faster to run, and added OS notifications when shell commands require user approval.
