    Share terminal with Agent
    Agents can now use your native terminal. A new terminal will be created when needed and runs in the background if one isnâ€™t already open. Click Focus to bring it up front where you can see Agent commands and also take over.

    View context usage in Chat
    At the end of a conversation you can now see how much of the context window is used.

    Faster edits
    Agent edits are now faster by lazy loading linter errors. Search & Replace edit latency has been reduced by 25% and Apply edits by almost 11%.
