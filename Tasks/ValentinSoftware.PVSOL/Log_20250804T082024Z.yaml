    The following new features and changes are included:
    - German “Solarspitzengesetz” (Solar Peak Act) can now be mapped in the economic efficiency.
    - Revised cashflow table:
    - Year 1 is now a full year.
    - The last year may only be part of a year.
    - The period of each year shown is listed.
    - Display of the amortization period is no longer limited to the observation period.
    - Photo Plan: Re-implementation of Braas roof tiles, Velux roof windows and measuring tools.
    - In the circuit diagram, the DC intermediate-coupled battery systems are now drawn on the DC side of hybrid inverters.
    - MeteoSyn: In case of errors during the import of climate data, the possible error is now indicated.
    - In the simulation with a thermal system, the maximum value for hot water consumption was increased to 1,000,000 kWh.
    - Improvement of the translation.
    - New offline database.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Crash in the simulation if the inverter characteristic curve only showed a value of over 0 % at a utilization rate of 10 %.
    - Charging the e-vehicle from the battery system was not shown in the coverage of total consumption diagram.
    - Licence management issue with error 401.
    - Error in the login dialog of the license management:
    - Login dialog did not respond.
    - Login dialog did not display any content.
    - Energy flow diagram:
    - Display of energy flows from battery to electric car corrected.
    - Error in balancing when using heating element.
    - Error when saving the project files if characteristic curves should also be saved.
    - Crash in the assignment of DC charge controller and inverter connections when using more than 10 DC battery systems.
    - Crash in the characteristic curves if there was no PV yield in individual months.
    - Partial crashes of the minute value synthesis at Brazilian locations.
    - Photo Plan: Help could not be accessed with F1.
    - Diagram PV energy during observation period did not show the correct observation period for projects located outside Germany.
    - Partial problems with the diagrams for the economic calculation.
    - User profiles: The tooltips were “hard coded”.
    - The parameters "Year", "Month" and "Day" sometimes described a DateTime that could not be displayed.
    - Automatic configuration search sometimes did not deliver any results for the SMA Tripower Core 2.
    - The power specification of the backup generator was incorrect in the circuit diagram.
    - Crash on the inverter window if the power optimizer field was clicked first and then the inverter model field immediately afterwards.
    - Problems when entering degrees, minutes and seconds of coordinates in the map tool search.
