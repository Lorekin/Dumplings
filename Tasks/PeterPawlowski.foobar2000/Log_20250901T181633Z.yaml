    - Built-in UPnP media renderer, both client (play to another device) and server (be controlled by another device).
      - Other foobar2000 instances on your local network, with UPnP remote control feature active, will be listed as output devices.
      - foobar2000-to-foobar2000 playback shows tags with album covers on the other end, using Ogg FLAC as stream container.
    - Media Library improvements, most notably:
      - Can natively index FTP/WebDAV/SMB network shares.
      - Improved response to enabling/disabling/installing/uninstalling decoders - only reloads info from affected music files.
    - Codecs, most notably:
      - FFmpeg updated to 8.0, added native support for xHE-AAC decoding.
      - Rewritten Ogg FLAC tag handling, properly implemented embedded album art.
      - Fixed ReplayGain tags not being saved in multichapter Ogg/Opus files.
    - Portable install improvements
      - Changed the way relative paths are handled, so cached tags are no longer forgotten after relaunching from a different path.
      - Made possible so specify no-cover pics as relative path to install location.
    - Converter:
      - Enabled RF64 writing.
      - Fixed Converter failing to function until foobar2000 restart after removal of %TEMP%\foo_converter.
    - Other
      - Added preferences page for network share credentials so you don't have to place them in URLs anymore.
      - Made editing DSP settings momentarily lower output latency to make DSPs appear more responsive.
      - Fixed Properties 'rewrite tags' not working if nothing has been edited.
      - Installer is now hi-DPI friendly.
      - Made system file dialogs invoked out-of-process, to avoid stability issues.
    - See release notes for full list of changes.
