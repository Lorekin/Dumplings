    A Farewell to Consoles
    - We've merged consoles and files.
    - A migration dialog will help you transfer all your consoles to files and guide you through the new workflow.
    - Query files are now saved in the queries folder within the project folder.
    - Files with an attached database context now show a data sourceâ€“like icon instead of the generic database icon used before.
    - The Jump to Query File button on the Database Explorer toolbar lists all query files associated with the current data source.
    - The old Database Consoles folder under Scratches and Consoles will remain for one more release cycle.
