    Logtalk compiler and runtime
    - ADDED: Support for declaring synchronized predicates in calls to the create_object/4 and create_category/4 built-in predicates.
    Documentation
    - ADDED: Glossary definition for "debug handler".
    Library
    - CHANGED: The implementation of the sets library predicates member/2 and selectchk/3. Also improved the documentation of the library and fixed the mode/2 directives of several of its predicates.
    - IMPROVED: Warning messages when a library is not supported by a backend.
    Tools
    - IMPROVED: The debugger tool code and documentation for a more consistent handling and description of breakpoints. Also added additional tests.
    - UPDATED: The logtalk_tester.* scripts to also print the operating-system version after the Logtalk and Prolog backend versions.
    - FIXED: The debugger tool missing tokenization for the message matching_conditional_spy_points_removed.
    - FIXED: The packs tool restore/1-2 predicates when using the default option force(true) to allow restoring a pack when a pack with the same name is installed from a different registry.
    Tests
    - ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard atom_concat/3 built-in predicate from WG17 work.
    IDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support
    - RENAMED: The coding/codemirror directory to coding/codemirror5.
    - ADDED: CodeMirror 6.x support (in the coding/codemirror6 directory).
    - ADDED: VSCode support predicates debug/0 and nodebug/0.
    - IMPROVED: TextMate 2.x and Vim support for automatic indentation.
    - IMPROVED: VSCode support to avoid spurious errors when a find predicate declaration or definition is accidentally triggered for invalid text.
    - FIXED: VSCode support finding of references to a predicate alias declared in a uses/2 directive.
    - FIXED: VSCode support finding of a local predicate (or non-terminal) definition when provided by an included file.
    - FIXED: VSCode support finding of a local predicate (or non-terminal) reference to not report calls from auxiliary predicates (as the reflection API reports line zero in these cases).
    - FIXED: VSCode support when using the code navigating features resulted in predicate property queries to the user built-in object that would throw an error.
