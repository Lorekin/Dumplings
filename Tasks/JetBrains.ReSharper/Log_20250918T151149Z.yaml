    ReSharper 2025.2.2
    To make your transition to Visual Studio 2026 seamless, ReSharper now installs a lightweight migration extension bundled with the product. This extension will be carried over automatically by Visual Studio when you upgrade to the 2026 release. You will then be able to launch the ReSharper installer for Visual Studio 2026 from the Extensions menu by selecting ReSharper Installer | Install ReSharper.
    Notable fixes:
    - We've introduced support for xUnit v3 3.x, so you can now run tests without compatibility issues when upgrading from earlier xUnit versions. [RSRP-501333]
    - The Search Everywhere dialog now auto-fills with the text selected in the editor in Out-of-Process mode. [RSRP-500894]
    - There are no more false Cannot resolve symbol warnings for valid XML documentation references in C# code. [RSRP-501683]
    - Licenses from the License Vault are once again applied automatically on Visual Studio startup. [RSRP-500218]
    - Rider no longer incorrectly reports valid symbols as unresolved after updating to 2025.2.1, both in Visual Studio and when running InspectCode. [RSRP-501671]
