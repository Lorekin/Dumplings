Note that this may limit the precision of these properties to millisecond-level. For precise frame timing use Time.time instead. (UUM-96465)
    - WebGL: Fixed an issue with build and run when using Gzip in release mode on MacOS. (UUM-99397)
    - Windows: On Windows, fixed a few related bugs where if the Unity project/player settings were set to the Quad speaker mode, we would still output sound to the front center channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. Similarly, if Unity is set to use the surround (5.0) speaker mode, we would still output sound to the LFE channel on a 5.1 or 7.1 system. This has now been fixed. (UUM-52906)
