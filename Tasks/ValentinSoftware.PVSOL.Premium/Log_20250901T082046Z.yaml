    The following new features and changes are included:
    - Revised calculation of direct own use of PV energy for DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery systems with time-controlled charging from the grid.
    - When planning with a DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery system with time-controlled charging and the energy at the inverter input is less than the charge of the DC storage, the Sankey diagram is no longer displayed in the results. This can occur if the DC storage is also charged from the grid.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Crash when opening the Results page if a project from the previous version is loaded in which the simulation results were saved.
    - Error in the display of data series from thermal systems when exporting to a *.csv file.
ReleaseTime: 2025-09-01
