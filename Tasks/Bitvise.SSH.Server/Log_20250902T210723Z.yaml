    - Authentication:
      - In previous versions, the SSH Server could enter a state where the login attempt delay feature, which protects against brute-force password guessing, could cause all connections from an IP address to be refused, until a connection arrived from a different IP address, which would unblock the internal state. Fixed.
        The setting Penalty login attempt delay is configured in Advanced settings > Connections. It is enabled by default. This setting is essential to limit the effectiveness of brute-force password guessing. If this setting is disabled, password authentication should also be disabled, or the administrator must ensure that all passwords are long, randomly generated and secure.
