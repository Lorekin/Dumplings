    Release highlights:
    - PyCharm now autodetects Python interpreters installed with pyenv.
    - When you use the Extract Method refactoring, PyCharm will automatically infer and insert parameter type hints.
    - Instead of hard-coding a path, you can now use built-in macros (like $PROJECT_DIR$) to define the working directory in your Python test configurations.
    - During a remote debug session, the IDE will open your local project files instead of a copy of remote sources.
    - PyCharm no longer incorrectly flags code after a finally block as unreachable if the try statement contains a nested if.
    - The original PYTHONPATH entries are now preserved when running configurations with a Docker Compose interpreter.
    - PyCharm no longer reports a false warning when @classmethod is not the last decorator applied.
    - The remote debug server can now be stopped reliably.
    - The debugger no longer gets stuck on Collecting data... when a Mock local variable exists in a frame.
    AI Playground improvements:
    - You can now use models via OpenRouter in AI Playground by adding your own API key, giving you access to more providers.
    - You can now easily create a new playground session with the same model and settings.
    - Model settings have been reorganized for an improved selection and parameter editing experience.
    - Redesigned model filtering makes it easier to choose specific models from each provider.
