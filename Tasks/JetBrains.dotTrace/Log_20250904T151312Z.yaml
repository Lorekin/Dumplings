    ReSharper 2025.2.1
    Unity support now included in ReSharper's Command Line Tools
    Starting with this update, you can now take advantage of ReSharper's Unity-specific inspections and cleanup rules not only in the IDE, but also when running Command Line Tools such as inspectcode and cleanupcode. Unity support is now part of the CLT package, ensuring consistency between what you see in the IDE and what runs in your CI/CD pipelines.
    Important fixes included in this update:
    - ReSharper C++ now operates in Out-of-Process (OOP) mode when installed by itself, without ReSharper. [RSRP-501568]
    - C++ unit tests can be run in OOP mode. [RSCPP-36925].
    - The Search Everywhere dialog can now receive focus even before the solution is fully loaded in OOP mode. [RSRP-500233]
    - Restored the correct behavior of IDE shortcuts in OOP mode. [RSRP-501231]
    - The ReSharper installer once again works correctly when installing to Visual Studio 2022 Preview. [RSRP-501104]
    - Eliminated an issue where Visual Studio could freeze after triggering ReSharper actions or opening the Extensions menu. [RSCPP-36931]
    - Restored the correct behavior of code completion when typing in async contexts. [RSRP-500499]
