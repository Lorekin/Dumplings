    The Early Access Program (EAP) for CLion 2025.3 has officially launched. The first EAP build, 253.17525.83, provides an early look at some of the improvements coming in the next major release.
    Here are some of the key features and bug fixes included in CLion 2025.3 EAP 1:
    - We’ve implemented a constexpr debugger, which allows you to debug constexpr evaluations, including consteval functions, in the same way as with a regular debugger. You can perform basic debugging actions, such as stepping through the code or observing the evaluation stack, and use other features available during standard runtime debugging. Read our blog post to learn more.
    - Several usability improvements have been made to the PlatformIO integration. You can now specify environment variables in run/debug configurations and receive suggestions to reload a PlatformIO project when new files are added to the project root. Additionally, there is now an option to load the project as a PlatformIO project when no other model is present.
    - The Serial Port Monitor plugin has also received a number of enhancements, such as shortcuts for adding and removing profiles, support for custom baud rates, and UI updates, including a new tool window icon and a JetBrains Marketplace logo.
    - You can now inspect variables when debugging on Windows ARM64 using the MSVC toolchain with the bundled LLDB.
    - The debugger now detects errors in conditional breakpoint evaluation and displays them in the gutter.
    - When extracting a method or function with CLion Nova enabled, you can now set the return value to one of the local variables.
    - CLion Nova now supports new C++26 features, such as pack indexing, packs in structured binding declarations, and expansion statements.
    - CLion Nova’s editor tooltips now show the total number of padding bytes in a class, helping you optimize your objects’ memory layout.
    - CLion Nova now supports the _Complex and _Imaginary C99 modifiers for floating-point types.
