    Rider 2025.2.2 comes with the following updates:
    Junie is out of Beta
    The AI coding agent by JetBrains now provides stable support across all languages and technologies supported in Rider.
    .NET Aspire support
    The bundled .NET Aspire plugin now comes with the Add .NET Aspire Orchestration action for creating, running, and managing Aspire projects directly from the IDE.
    Major fixes included in this build:
    - The working directory for .NET Run configurations now correctly points to the output directory (OutDir) instead of the project root when using launchSettings.json. [RIDER-128989]

    - There are no more false Cannot resolve symbol warnings for valid XML documentation references in C# code. [RSRP-501683]
    - The Flip context action now works correctly for method parameters in both declarations and invocations. [RIDER-126552]
    - .uprojectdirs files now load correctly and no longer cause Rider to get stuck during the Loading projects step. [RIDER-129467]
    - Running and debugging on Xbox once again works reliably. [RIDER-129942]
    - Full line code completion (FLCC) no longer duplicates already typed symbols in the editor. [RIDER-122389]
    - Scratches and Consoles files can now be added to Junie contexts without issues. [RIDER-128529]
