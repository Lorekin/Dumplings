    Rider 2025.2.0.1 comes with the following fixes:
    - Running an Unreal Engine project would no longer open the Unreal Project Browser instead of the project itself. [RIDER-128863]
    - The Split Line action once again uses correct ranges for code completion. [RIDER-128778]
    - Code completion no longer duplicates the first character of the completed item when invoked near a space. [RIDER-128694]
    - Switching views in the IL Viewer no longer causes the file to unintentionally open in the editor. [RIDER-125818]
    - Remote debugging connectivity was restored for cross-platform scenarios. [RIDER-128959]
    - We've also fixed the issue with formatting the command-line arguments on Windows for processes that run detached from the bundled terminal view, causing them to be stuck or cause errors during startup. [RIDER-128831]
