    - AI-powered Commit Composer (Preview): Use AI to help organize your Git commits into clear, logical stories by breaking up uncommitted changes into meaningful commits or recomposing previous commits. It‚Äôs ideal for cleaning things up before a pull request or when you‚Äôve just been‚Ä¶ coding a little too fast.
    - Launchpad: Team mode is graduating from preview! Users will require an Advanced license (or higher) to continue using Team mode.
