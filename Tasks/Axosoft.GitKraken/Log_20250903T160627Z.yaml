    “No prob-llama: Ollama setup just got easier.”
    Improvements 🙌
    - Added a new Ollama option to the GitKraken AI preferences, which works the same as <Custom URL>. This provides a clearer path for users wanting to connect their local Ollama server, making the setup process more intuitive.
    Bug Fixes 🐛
    - Fixed an issue where custom instructions were not enabled when GitKraken AI was set as the only configured provider on gitkraken.dev.
    - On Jira Cloud issue search, fixed “The requested API has been removed” errors.
    - Fixed an issue where some integrations could not connect when using certain proxy configurations (such as those requesting optional client certificates).
