    Improved search functionality
    The new search (and replace) dialog has an improved UI and is now "block aware", meaning that one can choose to search within the current block or across all blocks. The search settings (within the current block, case sensitivity, whole words) also affects the Cmd/Ctrl-D command for selecting the next occurrence of the current selection.
