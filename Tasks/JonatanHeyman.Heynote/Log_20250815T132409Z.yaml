    What's New
    Tabs
    You now get a visual representation of open buffers in the form of tabs. The tabs are integrated in the menu bar to take up as little screen real estate as possible, and they can also be turned off - completely or just in fullscreen mode - in the settings.
    Spellchecking
    It's now possible to turn on/off spellchecking. This can be done by clicking the spellchecking icon in the status bar. There are also heynote commands that can be bound to custom keys to enable/disable/toggle spellchecking.
    Other fixes and improvements
    - Added a pin icon to the status bar that can be used to toggle the "Always on top" setting (to make the windows float on top of other programs).
    - Added toggleAlwaysOnTop command that can be used to bind a key that toggles the "Always on top setting".
    - Remember the open buffer(s) between program restarts.
    - Fixed so that Alt-clicking on an cursor removes it (if more than one cursor exists).
    - Changed the key binding for rectangular selection from Alt+Click to Alt+Shift+Click.
    - Fixed issue where the window position wouldn't be properly restored in some cases.
    - Updated to latest version of Electron.
