    - Fix MCP icon displaying as white/black blocks. #58347
    - Fix crash when running 'teleport backend clone' on non-Linux platforms. #58332
    - Disabled MySQL database health checks to avoid MySQL blocking the Teleport Database Service for too many connection errors. MySQL health checks can be re-enabled by setting max_connect_errors on MySQL to its maximum value and setting the environment variable TELEPORT_ENABLE_MYSQL_DB_HEALTH_CHECKS=1 on the Teleport Database Service instance. #58331

    - Added an optional session recording summarizer that uses OpenAI or a compatible API.
