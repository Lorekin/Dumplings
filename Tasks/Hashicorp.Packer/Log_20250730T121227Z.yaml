      This change standardizes our release process and ensures a more secure and reliable pipeline for plugin delivery.

      GH-13412
    - core/HCP: This change corrects the example docs to move the registry block to the top level of the template file
      GH-13427
    - core: This update adds a new section explaining conditional expressions in HCL, including syntax, usage examples, and best practices for clarity and maintainability.
      The documentation covers how to use conditionals for default values, dynamic argument omission, and recommends using locals for complex logic.
      GH-13429
    BUG FIXES:
    - core: Fixes the default execute command for script and scripts to its original behavior from v1.12.0.
