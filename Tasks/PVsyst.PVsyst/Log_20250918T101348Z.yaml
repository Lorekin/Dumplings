    - Databases update
    - Optimizers, database: new AndSolar optimizers

    - Weather data: updated NSRDB Physical Solar Model used to download data North America from v3 to v4.

    * Corrections

    - Batch mode: changing variant and AC wiring loss at the same time in the batch run no longer leads to an infinite loop
    - Interactive map: searching for "latitude, longitude" in the interactive map is now working properly
    - Module layout: displaying I/V curves after aborting shading calculation no longer causes crashes
    - Optimizers: fixed issue with optimizer duty cycle applied twice during inverter power clipping
    - Power sharing: the situation where a single sub-array remains in a power sharing configuration is now handled properly
    - Report: "electrical shadings effect" is no longer printed when backtracking is activated with unlimited trackers, horizontal axis
    - Trackers, irradiance optimization: the range of search and estimate for the diffuse shadings in the irradiance optimization algorithm has been corrected
    - Weather data, Solargis: improved validation of country name when importing CSV files.
