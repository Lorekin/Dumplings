    * New Features

    - Optimizers, SolarEdge: it is now possible to define subarrays with heterogeneous strings (**).

    * Improvements

    - 3D scene: two redundant error messages concerning the azimuth and tilt spread in averaged orientations have been removed
    - 3D scene: import of scene now creates one single averaged orientation by default. An option allows re-enabling automatic detection of multiple orientations
    - Ageing tool: enabled tool tips to provide information on CSV output generation
    - Optimizers: Optimizer efficiency is now applied after module related losses (**)
    - Optimizers: power clipping is now better handled (**)
    - Weather data, Solargis: updated URL links in the TMY API integration UI to new Knowledge Base.

    * Corrections

    - 3D scene: small width changes in PV table dimensions (<3cm) now modify the total sensitive width/height (**)
    - 3D scene: changing scene view for the report no longer invalidates shadings table
    - 3D scene: improvement of the nomenclature for the dimensions of chimneys on sloping roofs
    - 3D scene: copying/pasting a PV object into the "List and management of objects" window no longer causes distortion of certain objects
    - 3D scene: PV module spacing and orientation from imported DAE files are now correctly saved within the variant
    - 3D scene: partition check box now works correctly for Polygonial field
    - Batch mode: shading table is now recomputed if backtracking parameters are changed in the batch simulation properties
    - Grid storage: revision of battery operation calculations (**)
    - System: number of modules in series now remains unchanged in systems combining subarrays with and without optimizers
    - Tools: voltage optimization plot now prints correctly
    - Trackers, diffuse shadings: "central tracker" and "custom tracker" modes now offer the choice of including shading objects in the calculation (**)
    - Weather data: the NSREL option is disabled when the data is not available for the selected site.
