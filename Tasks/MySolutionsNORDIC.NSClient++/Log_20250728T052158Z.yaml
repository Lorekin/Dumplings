    A summary of all changes since 0.8.0 which was the previous released version, if you have been using pre-releases then there are no changes.
    REST API updates
    Removed some old (deprecated) rest API endpoints.
    The oldest REST apis (endpoints starting without /api) were not stable as they exposed an JSON representation of the internal NSClient++ messages.
    To mitigate this the newer endpoints (which is found in the documentation) starting with /api/v1 or /api/v2 were added several years ago.
    Many of these old endpoints have now been removed which allowed us to migrate from the outdated JSON library to a more modern one.
    Note: The old check endpoints have NOT been removed to retain compatibility with Icinga and similar tools.
    In addition to this I have also added numerous integration test to help to keep the APIs stable.
    Installer improvments
    The installer has been updated a lot to behave more predictably and in general work better.
    I have also added numerous tests to the installer to ensure less accidental breaking changes in the future.
    Should not impact anything but instead of a dedicated Json library we now use boost to reduce number of dependencies.
    Removed sample config from installer (as you can easily generate the config i removed it from the installer).
    Documentation for installer config options have also been updated.
    One of the biggest changes now is that how keys are overridden behave more predictably:
    1. The tool (generic or op5) set the value
    2. Any existing configuration file will override the value set by the tool
    3. Any property (command-line or UI change) will override the value set previously
    4. Any value which is not same as config or default will be written during install.
    It will also handle rest settings and boot.ini properties correctly.
    Web UI improvements
    The web interface has gotten a medium overhaul improving settings and queries.
    You can now change setting under modules.
    Settings now have widgets for boolean settings
    Settings view now show all settings not just changed ones.
    You can now use " in queries when executing from the Web UI so "filter=1 > 2" is now possible,
    Improved settings and log widgets
    Updated installer (fixed overriding keys from command line)
    Added test cases for installer
    Restored Linux builds
    This is still a work in progress but for now you can build and run NSClient++ on Linux (there are pipelines as well for this).
    "Soon(TM)" I will add some packages and config files and such to make it more usable.
    Various other bugfixes:
    - Fixed https settings caching when using http(s) settings.
    - Fixed lots of compiler warnings and linting
    - Fixed indexing in arrays in lua
    - Fixed help screen typo by @vanitysys28 in #965
    - Installed should not place op5.ini config in subfolder (like since 0.6.x)
    - Settings now have a type (string, int, bool, etc)
    - Fixed: Hostname should not be lowercased
    - Change log level for connection closed when reading request to debug
    - Added signatures to exe files by @mickem in #981
      In this release nscp.exe and check_xxx.exe are digitally signed making using them hopefully a bit simpler on secured machines.
