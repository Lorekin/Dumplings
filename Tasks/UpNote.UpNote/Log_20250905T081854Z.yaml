    - Fixed an issue where templates could not be selected in the new note window.
    - Fixed an issue where pasting a link to a note in the new note window did not automatically populate the note title.
    - Fixed an issue where using the DeepL app on the computer could cause it to launch automatically when copying from UpNote, due to DeepLâ€™s shortcut Cmd + C + C.
    - Fixed an issue where copying a collapsed section and pasting it into a text editor only kept the section header without its content.
