    Known issues
    Video rendering issue
    When you resize a video window, you might experience issues with incoming video, such as displaying incorrectly or corrupted. It has been observed on laptops that have both Intel HD Graphics 520 and Nvidia GeForce 940MX, and we are working on resolving the issue. In the meantime, go to Preferences > Devices > Other Devices and change Video Render Mode to DirectX 9.
    Video call issues
    If the remote party tries to add video to an audio call on your Team Voice account, the call is dropped. If the caller tries to add video to an audio call, the call remains as an audio call. In order to use video, place the call as a video call.
