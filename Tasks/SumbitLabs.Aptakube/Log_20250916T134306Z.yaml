    üòé Improvements
    - Aptakube now remembers which containers you have enabled/disable during a Log Stream session. So if you enable a istio-proxy container during a log streaming session, it'll remain enabled when you come back. Discord
    - Replaced the custom aptakube.com/restartedAt annotation with the standard kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt during a restart action
    - added ServiceAccount hyperlink in Pod Overview Discord
    üêû Bugs Fixed
    - Fixed an issue when launching Node Shell pods on nodes with custom taints #479
    - Fixed an issue where log stream sessions would remain active even when no longer visible Discord
    - Fixed an issue with how we compute status for StatefulSet Discord
    - Fixed a bug with ConfigMap / Secret link from environment variables Discord
