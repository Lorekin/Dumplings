    The new version InternetOff 3.0 is just released. It adds an ability to schedule an access to the internet, minor improvements and bug fix, support of Windows 10.

    What’s new?
    An ability to schedule the connection

    Now you can setup the timetable for internet connection. This option is useful
    to restrict access to the internet in specific hours of week days. For
    example you can disallow internet connection in the morning hours
    if you need to work without attractions.
    Windows 10 compatibility

    Despite the previous version worked with Windows 10 without issues,
    we have thoroughly tested the new version on compatibility with the latest version of
    Windows. So now we officially say that its compatible with Win10.
    Other minor changes
    - Bug fixed: Icon in the system tray disappeared after crash of the Explorer
    - Bug fixed:”About program” form could be called multiple times and this could cause
      displaying of errors
    - Other small improvements
