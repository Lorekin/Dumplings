    NEW FEATURES:
    - The new command terraform stacks exposes some stack operations through the cli. The available subcommands depend on the stacks plugin implementation. Use terraform stacks -help to see available commands. (#36931)
    ENHANCEMENTS:
    - Filesystem functions are now checked for consistent results to catch invalid data during apply (#37001)
    - Allow successful init when provider constraint matches at least one valid version (#37137)
    - Performance fix for evaluating high cardinality resources (#37154)
    - TF Test: Allow parallel execution of teardown operations (#37169)
    - terraform test: Test authors can now specify definitions for external variables that are referenced within test files directly within the test file itself. (#37195)
    - terraform test: File-level variable blocks can now reference run outputs and other variables." (#37205)
    - skip redundant comparisons when comparing planned set changes (#37280)
    - type checking: improve error message on type mismatches. (#37298)
    BUG FIXES:
    - Added a missing warning diagnostic that alerts users when child module contains an ignored cloud block. (#37180)
    - Nested module outputs could lose sensitivity, even when marked as such in the configuration (#37212)
    - workspace: Updated validation to reject workspaces named "" (#37267)
    - workspace: Updated the workspace delete command to reject "" as an invalid workspace name (#37275)
    - plan: truncate invalid or dynamic references in the relevant attributes (#37290)
    - Test run Parallelism of 1 should not result in deadlock (#37292)
    - static validation: detect invalid static references via indexes on objects. (#37298)
    - Fixes resource identity being dropped from state in certain cases (#37396)
    NOTES:
    - The command terraform rpcapi is now generally available. It is not intended for public consumption, but exposes certain Terraform operations through an RPC interface compatible with go-plugin. (#37067)
    UPGRADE NOTES:
    - terraform test: External variables referenced within test files should now be accompanied by a variable definition block within the test file. This is optional, but users with complex external variables may see error diagnostics without the additional variable definition. (#37195)
