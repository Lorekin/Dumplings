  Value: |-
    + [SKIF] Added support for downloading and using covers from PCGamingWiki.
     + [SKIF] Fixed missing Epic Games Store cover art caused by recent EGS server changes.
     + [SKIF] Improved thread-safety on JSON Meta DB file access.
     + Apply Latency Waitable SwapChain fix universally; cause: NVIDIA Streamline.

       * Streamline never waits on the SwapChain, and when frame generation is
           not active, Reflex may also not be active, leading to unncessary latency!
