    What's fixed:
    - We've fixed the editing functionality in tool windows in the Remote Development mode (IJPL-198605).
    - We've improved the appearance and behavior of gutter icons during a debugging session, so they are neither overlaid nor obstructed by the Run to Cursor popup (IJPL-204736).
    For more details, please see the release notes.
