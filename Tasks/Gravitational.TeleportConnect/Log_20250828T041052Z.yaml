    - Fix MCP icon displaying as white/black blocks. #58347
    - Fix crash when running 'teleport backend clone' on non-Linux platforms. #58332

MySQL health checks can be re-enabled by setting max_connect_errors on MySQL to its maximum value and setting the environment variable TELEPORT_ENABLE_MYSQL_DB_HEALTH_CHECKS=1 on the Teleport Database Service instance. #58331

    Enterprise:
    - For OIDC SSO, the IdP app/client configured for MFA checks is no longer expected to return claims that map to Teleport roles. Valid claim to role mappings are only required for login flows.

    - Added an optional session recording summarizer that uses OpenAI or a compatible API.
