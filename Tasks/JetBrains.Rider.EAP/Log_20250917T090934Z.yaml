    The Early Access Program for Rider 2025.3 Is Here!
    This first build brings a variety of updates for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and more.
    Unity
    - Added an IL Viewer for Unity projects.
    Unreal Engine
    - Customizable folders and files in the .uproject project model.
    Godot
    - Added support for typed Dictionary in GDScript.
    - Inconsistent leading whitespace inspection for GDScript files.
    - New project template for developing GDExtensions.
    - Added support for the Chickensoft GoDotTest test runner.
    - Rider can now automatically build when focus moves away from the IDE, ensuring the Godot Inspector reloads and updates exported properties.
    Solution management
    - You can now create .slnx solution files directly from Rider templates, without having to manually convert .sln files.
