    Rider 2025.3 EAP 2 is out with the following changes:
    Godot
    - Improvements to GDScript debugging, including support for debugging specific scenes, tool scripts, and devices, as well as passing arguments.
    - Expanded GDScript language support with better handling of nested classes and enums. The inspection for unused parameters has also been refined to highlight the parameter itself.
    New Islands theme
    - Rider now includes the new Islands theme, giving the IDE a refreshed look and feel. You can enable it in Settings/Preferences | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance | Theme. Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback as we continue refining it.
    C++ debugging
    - When debugging minidumps, Rider can now automatically download binaries and symbols from symbol servers.
    Fixes and improvements
    - The Code Annotations settings page no longer gets stuck in a loading state.
    - Surround With and related actions now behave as expected.
    - Environment.CurrentDirectory now correctly points to the output directory when using a Launch Settings run configuration.
    - Menus on Linux now have rounded corners for a more consistent look across platforms.
    - The Show Usage popup now displays the full file path.
