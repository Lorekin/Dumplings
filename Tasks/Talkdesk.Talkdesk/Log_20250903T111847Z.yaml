    On Friday, August 29th, 2025, a new Desktop App 2.4.0 version will be available on the download page.
    Enhancement:
    - Update to MSI Installer: The MSI installer was updated to run as a 64-bit application instead of 32-bit, to improve performance. As stated in the documentation, when updating the MSI installer package, the previous version must be uninstalled before deploying the newer version.
    Fix:
    - We corrected a bug from version 2.2.1 that forced dashboard links to open in the browser. Now, they'll correctly open in the desktop app, ensuring your downloads work as expected.
