    Input Director v2.3 is available for download.
    New features include:
    - Profiles - A profile encapsulates the client systems, their configurations, and the monitor layout. Profiles are useful for many different situations, such as:
    - Using the same computer across different locations, each with their own set of computers
    - If one or more computers alternate between a varying number of connected monitors
    - If a monitor is shared between two computers, different profiles can be configured and assigned hotkeys to quick switch between them
    - Quick switch between profiles from the ID context menu, by hotkey or via the new command line tool
    - Auto switch between profiles when the number of monitors connected to the Director changes
    - A new command line tool makes it easy to query and drive Input Director directly or via a script
    - Command line integration can be disabled from the Security tab in the application
    - If using monitor numbers when editing a system's monitor layout, Input Director will display each monitor number on the monitor
    - A What's New window will pop-up once with information on the latest release when upgrading
    - Defaulted applying the Windows enhanced pointer precision setting, when directing clients, to false on new installs
    - Fixed bug that could block transitions in the corners of a screen
    - Input Director will now notify when disabling itself due to remote desktop being active and display options to re-enable or change its behaviour
    - Upgraded OpenSSL library to v3.3.1
    - Minor bug fixes
    I'd like to thank all the volunteers for kindly giving their time to beta test v2.3, including Clifton, tongshinboan, Stormy, Steve Rumsby, Suresh, Jeff R., et. al
