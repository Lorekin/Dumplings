    🛠️ OneCommanderConnector with dialog live-following
    🐞 Fixed OneCommanderConnector taking focus from filename textbox on start

    🐞 A few users reported that Microsoft Defender flagged version 3.99 because of the code that refreshes the program’s pinned taskbar icon. This functionality has been present for the past two years and is not new, but to avoid further false positives it has now been removed. If your pinned taskbar icon appears broken after updating, simply unpin the program from the taskbar and pin it again to restore it.
