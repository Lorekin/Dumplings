    This update fixes a number of bugs that were found in the initial 3.1.5.0 update, including a flaw in Print/PDF output that could leave some text missing. It is recommended you upgrade at your next convenience, or before compiling anything important to PDF.
    If you have attempted to update from an older system and find yourself with a copy that no longer runs, please uninstall and visit our legacy download page to fetch an older copy of the software.
    Refinements and Changes
    - Adjusted the Dark Mode theme to use a darker text highlight for project search results, keeping the light-coloured text readable.
      Note: If the Dark Mode theme is in use when upgrading to 3.1.5.1, you will need to switch to another theme and then back to Dark Mode to see the changes.
    - Increased the adjustability of the text-to-speech rate and pitch sliders, allowing fine-tuned control of the settings.
    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug whereby arbitrary chunks of text could be missing from a compiled PDF.
    - Fixed an error related to text-to-speech services that occurred on some systems and prevented Scrivener from launching.
    - Fixed a bug whereby some imported webpages would not display in the editor and might prompt to select an alternative application to open the MHT file. This also fixes
      - A related issue of the Compile Format Designer window giving the same prompt.
      - An inability to complete the in-software purchasing of an upgrade or cross-platform discount.
    - Restored copying and pasting formatted text from Scrivener to other applications like Word and OpenOffice Writer, which broke in 3.1.5.0 so that formatting was lost on paste.
    - Fixed a bug whereby most paragraph settings were omitted when using Format ▸ Copy Formatting and ▸ Paste Formatting.
    - Fixed a bug whereby after-paragraph spacing did not correctly apply when creating new list items.
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1.5.0 whereby the Notes Background colour in the Options:Appearance settings did not affect the interface.
    - Fixed a bug whereby a custom Comments & Footnotes Area Background colour was not preserved through closing and reopening Scrivener when applied in any but the Default theme.
