    Mostly internal bug fixes.
    - Kodu was having trouble importing worlds with multiple levels. The terrain files were getting duplicated and cross linked between the levels. This should be better now.
    - Some Vietnamese uses would not get all the language options. I’m still not sure what was causing this problem but I’ve made some changes that I hope will help.
    - The “Avoid” tile would occasionally cause a crash. This is now protected against.
