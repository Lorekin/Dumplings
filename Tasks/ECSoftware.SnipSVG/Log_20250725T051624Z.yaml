    We have just released a small update to Premium Pack 5 that basically just adds compatibility with the new SnipSVG 2.0. All the skins in the Premium Pack now support the new animated SVGs and SVGs with embedded web video created by SnipSVG 2.0. There are just a couple of other small fixes.
    How to get the update:
    You can download and install the update with the link and credentials you received when you purchased. If you no longer have these, just contact support by email and we will help you out.
    Changes in 5.2.2
    - SVG support:
      Adds support for the animated SVG files and SVG files with embedded videos that can be created with SnipSVG version 2.0 and above.
    - Videos with captions in lightbox mode:
      To comply with accessibility standards, Help+Manual now includes a <figure> tag around the video placeholder image. This prevented videos with captions from being displayed correctly in lightbox mode, which has now been corrected.
    - Link errors in V2 Modern skins:
      Some V2 Modern skins included debug code that displayed an alert when any link was clicked in a topic page.
    - Social sharing link:
      In individual skins, the social sharing link window opened could close instantly if it was opened a second time in a new topic.
